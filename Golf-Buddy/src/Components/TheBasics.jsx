            <h3 className="section-title">An Overview</h3>
            <ul className="section-body">
                <li>The objective of golf is to hit a ball into a hole with the fewest number of strokes possible. The player with the lowest number of strokes at the end of the game wins.</li>
                <li>Golf is played with a set of clubs, a golf ball, and a tee. Each club has a different purpose, and the player must choose the right club for each shot.</li>
                <li>Golf is played on a course consisting of 18 holes. Each hole has a starting point, a green, and a flagstick. The player must start each hole from the designated starting point and play the ball until it reaches the green and the flagstick.</li>
                <li>At the start of each hole, the player must tee up the ball on the tee box. Once the ball is in play, the player must hit the ball and advance it toward the hole.</li>
                <li>Understand the concept of a stroke: A stroke is counted every time the player hits the ball. The player must count all strokes, including penalties.
                </li>
                <li>There are many rules in golf, and violations can result in penalties. Common violations include hitting the ball out of bounds, hitting the ball into a hazard, or grounding the club in a bunker. Penalties can include adding strokes to the player's score or being disqualified from the game.</li>
                <li>If the ball goes out of bounds, the player must take a penalty stroke and hit the ball from the point where it went out of bounds.

                    Understand the rules for hazards: Hazards are areas on the course that are difficult to play from, such as sand traps, water hazards, or rough. If the ball lands in a hazard, the player must take a penalty stroke and hit the ball from the hazard.</li>
                <li>Putting is the act of hitting the ball into the hole on the green. The player must use a putter for this shot and must hit the ball with a gentle stroke.</li>
                <li>The player must finish the hole by hitting the ball into the hole. Once the ball is in the hole, the hole is considered complete, and the player can move on to the next hole.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className="section-title">The Golf Course</h3>

            <ul className="section-body">
                <img className="The-course" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0367/3682/7532/products/AugustawpicsNEWcardApril2016_533x.jpg?v=1605205143" />
                <li>Tee Boxes: The tee box is the starting point for each hole. There are usually several tee boxes to choose from, depending on the golfer's skill level. The tee boxes are marked with different colors to indicate their distance from the hole.</li>
                <li>Fairways: The fairway is the area of the course between the tee box and the green. It's usually mowed short and provides a clear path for the golfer to hit their ball towards the green.</li>
                <li>Greens: The green is the area of the course where the hole is located. The grass on the green is typically shorter and smoother than the fairway, making it easier to putt the ball into the hole.</li>
                <li>Bunkers: Bunkers are sand traps that are located on the course, often around the green or along the fairway. If your ball lands in a bunker, you'll need to hit it out of the sand.</li>
                <li>Water Hazards: Water hazards are bodies of water that are located on the course. If your ball lands in the water, you'll need to take a penalty stroke and hit the ball from where it went in or from a designated drop zone.</li>
                <li>Out of Bounds: Areas marked as out of bounds are off-limits, and hitting your ball out of bounds will result in a penalty stroke.</li>
                <li>Course Etiquette: It's important to follow course etiquette to maintain a safe and enjoyable playing environment. This includes not talking during another player's shot, repairing divots and ball marks on the green, and raking bunkers after use.</li>
                <li>Dress Code: Golf courses often have a dress code, which may include collared shirts, slacks, and golf shoes. Be sure to check the course's dress code before you play.</li>
                <li>Pace of Play: It's important to maintain a reasonable pace of play to avoid slowing down other players. Be ready to hit your shot when it's your turn and keep up with the group in front of you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className="section-title">The Bag</h3>
            <h4 className="section-blurb">A golf bag typically contains 14 clubs, each designed for a specific purpose. Here are the types of clubs you can expect to find in a typical golf bag:</h4>
            <ul className="section-body">
                <img className="The-bag" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/539dffebe4b080549e5a5df5/1653407551580-MWVZB2DEA5NMP5CHR7LM/vintage-Golf-Bag-Patent-drawing-poster-museum-outlets.jpg?format=750w" />

                <li>Driver: The driver is the longest club in the bag, and it's designed for maximum distance off the tee.</li>
                <li>Fairway woods: Fairway woods are designed to hit the ball off the ground for long shots in the fairway or from the rough.</li>
                <li>Hybrid clubs: Hybrid clubs combine the features of a wood and an iron to provide a versatile option for approach shots.</li>
                <li>Irons: Irons are numbered from 1 to 9, with the lower numbers providing less loft and more distance, and the higher numbers providing more loft and less distance. Irons are used for approach shots from the fairway or rough.</li>
                <li>Wedges: Wedges are used for short shots around the green, including bunker shots, chip shots, and pitch shots. There are three types of wedges: pitching wedge, sand wedge, and lob wedge.</li>
                <li>Putter: The putter is used on the green to roll the ball into the hole. Putters come in various shapes and sizes, and the choice of putter often depends on personal preference.</li>
                <li>Other clubs: Some golfers may carry additional clubs, such as a driving iron or a specialty wedge, depending on their playing style and the course they're playing on.</li>
                <li>It's important to note that there are rules governing the number of clubs a player can carry in their bag during a round of golf. The maximum number of clubs allowed is 14, and carrying more than this number can result in a penalty. By having a well-rounded set of clubs in your bag, you'll be prepared for a variety of shots and challenges on the course.</li>
            </ul>
